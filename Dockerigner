# Docker Practices for Nifty50 Stop Prediction

1. Use slim or alpine images where possible for fast builds.
2. Never store API keys inside Dockerfile, use environment variables instead.
3. Keep Postgres mapped to non-conflicting host ports (e.g., 5433 for container 5432).
4. Use docker-compose profiles for local vs prod later.
5. Add healthchecks for DB and API when scaling.
6. Mount volumes for models and data only during dev testing.
7. Rebuild services individually using:
   docker compose build backend
8. View logs cleanly using:
   docker compose logs -f backend
9. Use .gitignore to avoid pushing venv, env files, data, artifacts.
10. Use --no-cache during clean rebuilds when dependency conflicts appear.
